## Introduce

If you want to caption a training datasets for Image generation model(Stable Diffusion, Flux, Kolors or others)  
This tool can make a caption with danbooru style tags or a nature language description.

### New Changes:

2024.10.19: Add option to save WD tags and LLM Captions in one file.(Only support CLI mode or GUI batch mode.)

2024.10.18: Add Joy Caption Alpha One, Joy-Caption Alpha Two, Joy-Caption Alpha Two Llava Support.

2024.10.11: GUI using Gradio 5 now. Add Mini-CPM V2.6 Support.

2024.10.09: Build in wheel, now you can install this repo from pypi.

```shell
# Install torch base on your GPU driver. e.g.
pip install torch==2.5.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
# Install via pip from pypi
pip install wd-llm-caption
# For CUDA 11.8
pip install -U -r requirements_onnx_cu118.txt
# For CUDA 12.X
pip install -U -r requirements_onnx_cu12x.txt
# CLI
wd-llm-caption --data_path your_data_path
# GUI
wd-llm-caption-gui
```

2024.10.04: Add Qwen2 VL support.

2024.09.30: A simple gui run through gradio now😊

## Installation

Python 3.10 works fine.

Open a shell terminal and follow below steps:

```shell
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/fireicewolf/wd-llm-caption-cli.git
cd wd-llm-caption-cli

# create a Python venv
python -m venv .venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install torch
# Install torch base on your GPU driver. e.g.
pip install torch==2.5.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
 
# Base dependencies, models for inference will download via python request libs.
# For WD Caption
pip install -U -r requirements_wd.txt

# If you want load WD models with GPU.
# For CUDA 11.8
pip install -U -r requirements_onnx_cu118.txt
# For CUDA 12.X
pip install -U -r requirements_onnx_cu12x.txt

# For Joy Caption or Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct or Qwen2 VL Instruct
pip install -U -r requirements_llm.txt

# If you want to download or cache model via huggingface hub, install this.
pip install -U -r requirements_huggingface.txt

# If you want to download or cache model via modelscope hub, install this.
pip install -U -r requirements_modelscope.txt

# If you want to use GUI, install this.
pip install -U -r requirements_gui.txt
```

## GUI Usage

```shell
python gui.py
```

### GUI options

`--theme`
set gradio theme [`base`, `ocean`, `origin`], default is `base`.
`--port`  
gradio webui port, default is `8282`  
`--listen`  
allow gradio remote connections  
`--share`  
allow gradio share  
`--inbrowser`
auto open in browser  
`--log_level`  
set log level [`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`],  
default is `INFO`

## CLI Simple Usage

Default will use both wd and llm caption to caption images,  
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct on Hugging Face is a gated models.  
Joy caption used Meta Llama 3.1 8B, on Hugging Face it is a gated models,  
so you need get access on Hugging Face first.  
Then add `HF_TOKEN` to your environment variable.

Windows Powershell

```shell
$Env:HF_TOKEN="yourhftoken"
```

Windows CMD

```shell
set HF_TOKEN="yourhftoken"
```

Mac or Linux shell

```shell
export HF_TOKEN="yourhftoken"
```

In python script

```python
import os

os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "yourhftoken"
```

__Make sure your python venv has been activated first!__

```shell
python caption.py --data_path your_datasets_path
```

To run with more options, You can find help by run with this or see at [Options](#options)

```shell
python caption.py -h
```

### <span id="options">Options</span>
